# 3. How Many Transactions Can a Block Hold?

::: tip Question

Kaspa currently produces 10 blocks per second. So, how many transaction data can each block carry? What is the theoretical maximum TPS?

## (1). Answer to the Question

- Kaspa core developer Ori Newman gave a detailed explanation: [https://x.com/OriNewman/status/1974829990882553925](https://x.com/OriNewman/status/1974829990882553925)

- Important Concept: **mass**, which is the **unit** of data a block can carry. According to KIP-9 and KIP-13 standards, the mass limit per Kaspa block is **500,000 mass**.

- Different transactions occupy different amounts of **mass**. There are mainly the following three types of transactions:

- **Minimum Transaction (1 input, 0 outputs)**: Generally used for token burning, UTXO consolidation cleanup, etc. Rarely used in practice.

  * Each transaction occupies **584 mass**

  * Each block can carry 500,000 / 584 = **856** of such transactions.

- **Common Transaction (1 input, 2 outputs)**: Typical transfer transaction, spending one input and creating two outputs (sending to two addresses).

  * Each transaction occupies **2036 mass**

  * Each block can carry 500,000 / 2036 = **245** of such transactions.

- **Layer 2 Transaction (1 input, 1 output)**: Suitable for Layer 2 applications (such as state channels or smart contracts), transactions carry payloads.

  * Each transaction occupies **1452 mass**

  * Each block can carry 500,000 / 1452 = **344** of such transactions.

::: info Summary

- Calculating based on **minimum transactions**, each block can carry 856 transactions, and the transaction volume per second can reach **8560 TPS** (10 blocks per second). **But this transaction scenario is inherently rare and has no practical significance**

- Calculating based on common transactions and L2 transactions, the carrying capacity per block is between 245 - 344, and the transaction volume per second ranges between **2450 TPS ~ 3440 TPS**. **This is a reasonable, meaningful TPS value.**

## (2). Real-World Scenarios

Real-world transaction scenarios are more complex and may involve more transaction types. On the kas.fyi website, you can view the **Mass** value of each transaction, such as:
