This website was created during my process of learning about Kaspa, with the hope of providing help to all friends who are willing to understand Kaspa.

In the process of organizing the documentation, I will strive to maintain rigor and objectivity, and preserve information sources. If you find any errors, please feel free to criticize and point them out.
