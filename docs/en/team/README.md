## 1. Founder and Theoretical Architect - Yonatan Sompolinsky

### (1). Yonatan Basic Introduction

::: info Yonatan Sompolinsky Profile

Yonatan Sompolinsky is a very senior blockchain researcher and cryptography expert, and is the founder and theoretical architect of Kaspa. He holds a Ph.D. from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and conducted postdoctoral research at Harvard University (focusing on transaction ordering and MEV).

In 2013, Yonatan, together with his advisor Aviv Zohar, proposed the GHOST (Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree) protocol. The **GHOST protocol** addresses the scalability limitations of traditional blockchain consensus algorithms by introducing a more efficient way to achieve consensus. It has played a key role in the development of various blockchain systems, particularly those using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structures.

In 2016, Yonatan actively explored and advanced consensus algorithms for DAG-based systems. His research focused on finding effective methods to order transactions and prevent conflicts in DAG protocols, which led to the publication of the SPECTRE (Serialization of Proof-of-work Events) consensus algorithm, co-authored by Aviv Zohar. After these papers were released, the cryptocurrency and blockchain communities quickly became interested in Yonatan's work and began urging him to launch his own project.

In 2021, Yonatan founded KASPA, a Layer 1 blockchain running on a proof-of-work system that combines the GHOSTDAG protocol and uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

### (8). Yonatan and the Satoshi Nakamoto Rumor (For Entertainment Only)

Yonatan accidentally revealed that his birthday is April 5th. Coincidentally, "Satoshi Nakamoto," the creator of Bitcoin, also has this birthday.

![alt text](/kas/yonatan-birthday.png)

So people started digging deeper and found more coincidences, leading many to suspect that Yonatan is Satoshi Nakamoto. Of course, Yonatan himself strongly denies this.

For details, please see the following links, for entertainment only:

### (9). Yonatan Denies Being Satoshi Nakamoto in Interview (May 2024)

- [https://hackernoon.com/interview-with-dr-yonatan-sompolinsky-of-kaspa](https://hackernoon.com/interview-with-dr-yonatan-sompolinsky-of-kaspa)

::: info In this article, Yonatan denies being Satoshi Nakamoto:

**Q: In the comments of your YouTube interviews and Twitter Spaces, your fans often refer to you as Satoshi Nakamoto. How do you feel about this?**

Like an idiot.


**Q: Why?**

I mean, it's heartwarming that some people think I can write production-ready codebases like Satoshi. I only got a 62 in my undergraduate C/C++ course, and that was only because the instructor was lenient. Maybe if Bitcoin was released in Java and had copilot assistance, then I might have been Satoshi, who knows.

**Q: Do you know who Satoshi Nakamoto is?**

I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. Seriously, no one knows, and I don't think it's important to figure it all out. Satoshi's anonymity is at the core of Bitcoin's birth and the decentralization movement. Additionally, the value of discovering Satoshi's identity is overrated; take me for example, I know far more about cryptography and permissionless consensus than Satoshi; she (note: the original text uses "she") hasn't attended industry conferences in years.

## 4. Other Core Team Members

According to relevant statistics, in 2025, there are approximately one hundred related developers, with about 64 working on core protocol-related development.

Due to limited information, many are only known by their X accounts, and some don't even have known X accounts. If discovered, they will be updated here.

Welcome to the team, @IzioDev💚

@IzioDev is an experienced developer with over 15 years of experience in web development, infrastructure, and distributed systems; he has become a valuable asset to the #Kaspa community through maintaining @kasiamessaging
and improving the Rusty Kaspa network.

🎁 His first gift as a mainnet core developer? Completing the merge of Pull-Request 740 (also known as VSPCv2, initialized by D-stacks last week!)

This upgrade allows complete transaction data to be returned through a single RPC call. Now UTXO data can be easily accessed without complex processes, whereas in the past, multiple RPC calls and custom local logic were required to "connect" the data together.
