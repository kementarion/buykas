# Kaspa Introduction


## 1. Kaspa Basic Information

### (1). Mainnet Launch Date

November 7, 2021

### (2). Launch Method

Fair launch. No reserved tokens, no pre-mine, no VC capital.

::: info Decentralization

- Kaspa founder Yonatan and the development team have been working hard to promote the **decentralization** of the Kaspa project.

- Reference: [2025-07-01 Official Twitter Account Decentralization](../timeline/2025.md#_2025-07-01-官方-x-账号去中心化)

- Behind Kaspa, there is no company, no capital, and even the original official X account has been "decentralized." It mainly relies on community operation and support.

### (3). Consensus Mechanism

- Proof of Work (PoW)

- Mining algorithm: kHeavyHash



### (4). Maximum Supply

- **28.7 billion** KAS

- Fixed cap.

::: info Reminder

- As of October 2025, 93% has been mined (approximately **26.8 billion** KAS has been mined).

- Related discussion: [Future Miner Revenue Issues](../topic/1.Fee.md)

:::

### (5). Emission Model

- Initial block reward: 500 KAS per block.

- Mining rewards **decrease once a month, reducing by approximately half each year.** (Bitcoin reduces every four years and directly halves)

- For details, see: [https://kaspa.org/tokenomics-emission-and-mining/](https://kaspa.org/tokenomics-emission-and-mining/)



### (6). Block Production Speed (BPS)

- At project launch, block production was 1 block per second.

- Since the new version launched in May 2025, the current **block production is 10 blocks per second.**

- In the future, when the DagKnight protocol launches, block production could reach dozens to hundreds per second.

::: info Comparison:

- Bitcoin: **1 block every 10 minutes.**

- ZCash: **1 block every 75 seconds.**

- Dogecoin (DogeCoin): **1 block every 1 minute.**

- Litecoin (LiteCoin): **1 block every 2.5 minutes.**

:::

::: warning Important:

- Kaspa's extremely high block production speed makes transfers take **only one or two seconds**, which is unique among PoW coins and surpasses most PoS coins.

- **Kaspa is currently the only project in the entire crypto market that has achieved what the "Bitcoin Whitepaper" envisioned: a truly decentralized (PoW consensus), practically usable (second-level confirmation), peer-to-peer electronic cash system!**


- Bitcoin Whitepaper:

### (7). Transactions Per Second (TPS)

- Based on the current **10 blocks per second**, the Kaspa mainnet supports **two to three thousand** regular transfer transactions per second without delay.

- Technical Q&A: [How Many Transactions Can a Block Hold?](../topic/3.TrxInBlock.md)

- On October 5, 2025, the mainnet stress test completed **158 million** transactions in **24 hours**, with TPS ranging from hundreds to thousands. The system ran stably and smoothly, **with mainnet transfers arriving instantly, without delay.**

### (9). Name Origin

The name Kaspa comes from Aramaic, meaning "silver" and "money."

::: info Aramaic

Aramaic is an ancient language originating in the Middle East. It was the common language of the former Assyrian Empire and Persian Empire.

Due to long-term wars and political turmoil in the Middle East, Aramaic-speaking groups have been forced into exile in large numbers. Today, the total number of people who speak Aramaic (usually called "Neo-Aramaic") as their mother tongue may only be in the hundreds of thousands, mainly scattered in the border regions of Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and Iran.
