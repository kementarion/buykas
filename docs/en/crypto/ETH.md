# Ethereum Introduction

## 1. Genesis and Early Exploration (2013-2016)

Ethereum's concept originated from a young programmer — Vitalik Buterin (known online as **V-God**).

In 2013, he published the Ethereum whitepaper, aiming to create a general-purpose blockchain platform that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps), going beyond Bitcoin's limitation as merely "digital gold."

- 2014: Ethereum raised approximately $18 million through an ICO (Initial Coin Offering), with 1 BTC exchangeable for 2,000 ETH at the time (early ETH price was about $0.30).

- July 30, 2015: The Ethereum mainnet officially launched, the genesis block was born, and ETH began trading (price about $0.70 - $2.83).

- 2016: The DAO Event and Hard Fork

    - The DAO was a decentralized autonomous organization project based on Ethereum that raised $150 million worth of ETH, but due to a reentrancy vulnerability in its smart contract, it was attacked, resulting in the theft of 3.6 million ETH.

    - To recover losses, the community passed a hard fork to roll back the chain to its state before the attack. Most community members chose the new chain (the current Ethereum ETH), while a few members who insisted on "code is law" remained on the original chain (Ethereum Classic ETC). This event became the first major test in Ethereum's development history.

## 2. ICO Frenzy and Ecosystem Emergence (2017-2018)

In 2017, the ICO model of issuing tokens based on Ethereum emerged, with a large number of projects raising ETH, driving massive demand for ETH.

- Price surge: ETH price rose from about $8 in January 2017 to a high of nearly $1,400 in January 2018.

- Bubble burst: With regulatory intervention and many ICO projects breaking issue prices, the market entered a bear market. In 2018, ETH price fell significantly, dropping to about $80 by year-end.

## 3. DeFi Summer and ETH 2.0 Upgrade (2019-2021)

During the bear market, Ethereum's ecosystem innovation did not stop. Decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) began to flourish, mainly built on Ethereum, driving new demand for block space.

- Ecosystem explosion: Top DeFi applications like Uniswap (decentralized exchange), Aave (lending protocol), and NFT projects like CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club emerged.

- Price recovery: ETH price rose from the $100 - $300 range in 2019 to break through $700 in late 2020, and reached an all-time high of $4,891 in the November 2021 bull market.

- Technical evolution: Ethereum began its long upgrade path to proof of stake (PoS) (i.e., ETH 2.0), aiming to address network congestion and high gas fee issues.

## 4. The Merge and Maturity (2022-)

- September 15, 2022: The Merge

    - Ethereum successfully merged from proof of work (PoW) to proof of stake (PoS), reducing energy consumption by about 99.95%, laying the foundation for future scalability upgrades. At the time of the merge, ETH price fluctuated in the $1,000 - $1,500 range.

- 2024: Spot ETF Approval and Scalability Proposals

    - The U.S. SEC approved spot Ethereum ETFs, providing a compliant investment channel for traditional capital and attracting significant institutional fund inflows.

    - Vitalik proposed new scalability proposals, planning to replace the existing Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with a system based on the RISC-V architecture, expected to improve performance by 100 times, triggering market optimism.

    - Throughout 2024, ETH price rose amid volatility, from about $2,282 at the beginning of the year to breaking through $4,100 at its high, with a full-year gain of 48.57%.

- August 2025: Driven by Federal Reserve dovish rhetoric (interest rate cut expectations) and continued institutional fund inflows through ETFs, ETH price broke through $4,880, reaching a new all-time high.


## 5. Ethereum's Flaws

- Performance bottlenecks and high costs

    * The Ethereum mainnet can only process dozens of transactions per second (TPS). Historical data shows that during network congestion, gas fees for a single transaction can reach tens or even hundreds of dollars.
