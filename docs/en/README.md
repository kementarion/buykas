### **1. Traditional PoW Blockchains Have Significant Performance Bottlenecks**

- Bitcoin is slow, **producing one block every 10 minutes**, and does not support smart contracts.

- Ethereum ushered in the era of smart contracts, but **eventually shifted to PoS due to PoW performance bottlenecks**.

  * Even after shifting to PoS, Ethereum remains slow (transactions take tens of seconds to minutes), and fees are expensive.

- Solana sacrificed **decentralization** in pursuit of high throughput (adopting PoS + PoH mechanism). Moreover, system stability is insufficient, with multiple outages occurring.

  * For details, see: [Solana Outage After Trump Token Launch](/en/crypto/The-BlockChain-Trilemma.html#_2-solana-在日交易量几千万级时宕机)


::: tip Tip

These mainstream cryptocurrencies **all have obvious technical flaws.**

### **2. The PoS Mechanism Faces Many Controversies Regarding Decentralization**

- PoS is essentially **a compromise** to break through PoW performance limitations, and is actually **a detour in the development process**.

### **3. Kaspa Breaks Through PoW Performance Bottlenecks and Solves the Blockchain "Impossible Triangle"**

::: tip Info

Kaspa's founder Yonatan Sompolinsky is a very senior researcher in the crypto industry. For details: [Founder and Theoretical Architect - Yonatan Sompolinsky](./team/#_1-创始人和理论奠基人-yonatan-sompolinsky)

:::

- Kaspa adopts a **DAG-based (Directed Acyclic Graph) PoW protocol**, transforming the blockchain from **one-dimensional to multi-dimensional**, with a block production speed of **10 blocks per second**.

  * Next step: When the **DagKnight** protocol launches, block production speed will increase again (target: 100 BPS).

- On October 5, 2025, the mainnet stress test completed **158 million** transactions in **24 hours**, with TPS ranging from hundreds to thousands. The system ran stably and smoothly, **with mainnet transfers still arriving instantly, without delay.**

  * Details: [2025-10-05 Mainnet Stress Test](./timeline/2025.md#_2025-10-05-主网压力测试)

::: info Solana Performance

  * Solana's real-world record: 24-hour transaction volume of **100 million** (100M), with TPS around 1200. (2025)

- **Kaspa Solves the "Blockchain Trilemma":**

  * **Based on PoW**, it inherits and strengthens Bitcoin's **decentralization** and **security**.

  * **Based on DAG protocol**, it achieves **scalability** that surpasses Solana.

### **4. Kaspa Now Supports Layer 2 Smart Contracts**

- In September 2025, the Kasplex smart contract platform officially launched.

  * Details: [2025-09-26 Kasplex Smart Contract Launch](/en/timeline/2025.html#_2025-09-26-kasplex-智能合约上线)

  * View current smart contract projects: [https://kas.fyi/l2-networks](https://kas.fyi/l2-networks)

::: info About Layer 2

- Traditional Layer 2 smart contracts are **not Kaspa's goal**. Because traditional Layer 2 solutions often **divert rather than enhance** the network effects of Layer 1.

:::


### **5. Kaspa Established the More Advanced vProg Protocol**

- Founder Yonatan proposed the revolutionary vProg protocol, which is currently the **only "L2" architecture in the crypto field that can enhance rather than weaken L1 network effects**.

- Based on the vProg protocol, users can deploy smart contracts directly without relying on **traditional** Layer 2 platforms.

  * See details: [2025-09-11 vProg Protocol Whitepaper Release](/en/timeline/2025.html#_2025-09-11-vprog-协议黄皮书发布)

  * Or refer to Yonatan's post: [https://x.com/hashdag/status/1972416836110340509](https://x.com/hashdag/status/1972416836110340509)


### **6. Kaspa Is Committed to Solving the Miner Revenue Problem After PoW Block Rewards Disappear**

- Through the vProg protocol, L2 development will directly strengthen the L1 network, and L2 prosperity will increase miner revenue.

- In the future, miners can rely on transaction fees to maintain long-term, secure network operation, achieving long-term sustainability of PoW. See details: [Discussion on Future Miner Revenue Issues](./topic/1.Fee.md)


### **7. Summary**

::: tip **Carrying Forward the Past**

- Kaspa combines **Bitcoin's security consensus**, **Ethereum's smart contracts**, and **Solana's high throughput**, achieving a breakthrough in blockchain **scalability** through a DAG-based PoW protocol.

- The project adheres to **complete decentralization** and **community-driven** principles, upholding the **fair launch** principle, with **no pre-mine, no reserved tokens, no VC capital dominance**, making it the **true successor to Bitcoin and the Nakamoto consensus**.
