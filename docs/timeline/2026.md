> I'm happy to announce Silverscript! (Link in reply)
> 
> Silverscript is Kaspa's first high-level smart contract language and compiler. It enables DeFi, vaults, and native asset management directly on Kaspa's L1.
> 
> The language syntax is based on CashScript, but adds essential features like loops, arrays, and function calls.
> 
> It specializes in managing contracts with local state (UTXO model), serving as a complement and infrastructure layer for vProgs (shared state).
> 
> Note: Powered by new script engine features recently enabled on Testnet-12. The syntax is experimental and might evolve.
> 
> Please try it out and give feedback!
